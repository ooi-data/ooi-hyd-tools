The `cals` directory is the exact calibration values parsed from the calibration PDFS.
The `rca_correction_cals` directory is the calibration sensitivities with a correction applied (128.9 dB) given the 
parameters of the RCA broadband data - see the note in `PARSE_CAL_TO_NC.ipynb` or ooipy for more info.

NOTE 
CE04OSBP-LJ01C-11-HYDBBA105_10.nc is a placeholder (most recent available cal) but the correct cal for deployment 10 is not yet available.
RS03AXBS-LJ03A-09-HYDBBA302_3.nc is a placeholder (calibration for same instrument at later date) due to original cal file missing.
