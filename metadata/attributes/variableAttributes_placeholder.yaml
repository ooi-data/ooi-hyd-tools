    Computation followed ISO 18405 3.1.3.13.
sensitivity:
  long_name: Hydrophone sensitivity (dB re 1 volt / µPa) with OOI broadband offset applied (see comment)
  units: dB
  coverage_content_type: physicalMeasurement
  comment: >-
    IMPORTANT: OOI broadband hydrophone output is 24-bit ADC with maximum 3 volts.
    So, there are 8388608 / 3 = 2796202 counts per volt which is equivalent
    to 128.9 dB (=20log10(2796202)). This offset is applied (added) to the sensitivity.
